# SolarPanelSizing
A software program is presented here for estimating the major components of a solar PV system before starting the physical design. This software program should be able to assist the engineers from preliminary design to the implementation. Calculation of total power consumption based on the appliances used can be performed here. Array size of PV and number of batteries can be estimated based on the calculated power consumption by using this application software.
